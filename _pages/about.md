Hello! I'm undergraduate student at KAIST, major in Computer Science.

Currently, I'm working as a ML Engineer on [MOLOCO Korea](https://www.molocoads.com/), as an alternative form of mandatory military service.

I'm interested in:
- Recommender System
- Reinforcement Learning
- Competitive Programming
